    "    - **Incorrect interaction design**: The UC specifies a multi-step process for user input, but the SSTS describes a completely different or overly simplified flow that would break user expectations or reduce usability.\n",

    "    **FC - Fully Compliant**  \n",
    "    The SSTS document fully aligns with all functional requirements in the UC document, with no missing components or deviations. Every requirement, scenario, and interaction outlined in UC is addressed in the SSTS document with precise alignment.

    "    The SSTS document meets **most** of the functional requirements outlined in the UC document. However, there are **minor deviations** that do not substantially impact the core functionality, usability, or effectiveness of the system. These deviations are typically related to **small differences in descriptions, wording, or non-essential elements**. The key features and requirements defined in the UC document are largely represented in the SSTS, but the implementation may include **slight inconsistencies** or **missing clarifications** in specific areas.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### When to use **LC**:\n",
    "    - **Minor inconsistencies**: For example, the SSTS might describe the same functionality as in the UC but with slight wording or detail differences that do not affect the overall outcome.\n",
    "    - **Non-critical details**: Certain optional elements, like UI components, specific error handling behaviors, or output devices, might not be perfectly aligned with the UC but are not essential to the system’s core operations.\n",
    "    - **Minor omissions**: Some non-critical requirements, such as specific display formats or additional user interactions, may be omitted or underdefined in the SSTS but do not significantly impact the user experience or system function.\n",

    "    ### Examples of deviations that justify **LC**:\n",
    "    - A **UI control** might be described in the UC as a dropdown menu, while in the SSTS, it could be described as a simple text field—still functional, but not identical.\n",
    "    - **Minor output differences**, such as using “mobile speakers” instead of “vehicle speakers”, which do not change the fundamental interaction but could require minor clarification or adjustment.\n",
    "    - A **slightly different control method** for user interaction, such as replacing a manual button with a voice command for the same task.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Recommended Actions:\n",
    "    The SSTS document does **not** require a complete overhaul but would benefit from **minor refinements**. These may include:\n",
    "    - Clarifying language or descriptions for greater alignment with UC.\n",
    "    - Adding or refining optional features, UI elements, or error-handling mechanisms.\n",
    "    - Minor adjustments to output devices or interaction methods to fully match the UC specification.\n",

    "    ### Key Issues:\n",

    "    \n",
    "    ### Recommended Actions:\n",
    "    - **Add Missing Functionality**: Ensure the SSTS includes all key UC requirements, such as SWP restrictions and media control.\n",
    "    - **Revise Interaction Design**: Update the SSTS to support proper vehicle mode shifting and media features as per the UC.\n",
