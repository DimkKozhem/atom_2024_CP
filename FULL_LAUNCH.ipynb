    "    - **Incorrect interaction design**: The UC specifies a multi-step process for user input, but the SSTS describes a completely different or overly simplified flow that would break user expectations or reduce usability.\n",

    "    Compliance Level: Indicate the compliance level of SSTS with UC using one of these codes:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **FC - Fully Compliant**  \n",
    "    The SSTS document fully aligns with all functional requirements in the UC document, with no missing components or deviations. Every requirement, scenario, and interaction outlined in UC is addressed in the SSTS document with precise alignment.

    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "    The SSTS document meets **most** of the functional requirements outlined in the UC document. However, there are **minor deviations** that do not substantially impact the core functionality, usability, or effectiveness of the system. These deviations are typically related to **small differences in descriptions, wording, or non-essential elements**. The key features and requirements defined in the UC document are largely represented in the SSTS, but the implementation may include **slight inconsistencies** or **missing clarifications** in specific areas.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### When to use **LC**:\n",
    "    - **Minor inconsistencies**: For example, the SSTS might describe the same functionality as in the UC but with slight wording or detail differences that do not affect the overall outcome.\n",
    "    - **Non-critical details**: Certain optional elements, like UI components, specific error handling behaviors, or output devices, might not be perfectly aligned with the UC but are not essential to the system’s core operations.\n",
    "    - **Minor omissions**: Some non-critical requirements, such as specific display formats or additional user interactions, may be omitted or underdefined in the SSTS but do not significantly impact the user experience or system function.\n",

    "    ### Examples of deviations that justify **LC**:\n",
    "    - A **UI control** might be described in the UC as a dropdown menu, while in the SSTS, it could be described as a simple text field—still functional, but not identical.\n",
    "    - **Minor output differences**, such as using “mobile speakers” instead of “vehicle speakers”, which do not change the fundamental interaction but could require minor clarification or adjustment.\n",
    "    - A **slightly different control method** for user interaction, such as replacing a manual button with a voice command for the same task.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Recommended Actions:\n",
    "    The SSTS document does **not** require a complete overhaul but would benefit from **minor refinements**. These may include:\n",
    "    - Clarifying language or descriptions for greater alignment with UC.\n",
    "    - Adding or refining optional features, UI elements, or error-handling mechanisms.\n",
    "    - Minor adjustments to output devices or interaction methods to fully match the UC specification.\n",

    "    **PC - Partially Compliant**  \n",
    "    The SSTS document addresses some of the UC requirements but has **notable gaps or deviations** that could affect intended functionality or usability.

    "    \n",
    "    The SSTS document **fails to meet** key functional requirements outlined in the UC, showing **significant omissions** and **misalignments** in both functionality and user interaction design. These gaps prevent the system from fulfilling critical UC expectations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Key Issues:\n",
    "    1. **Missing Critical Features**: The SSTS omits the requirement that **calls can only be made when the vehicle is stopped via SWP**, as specified in the UC.\n",
    "    2. **Missing I\n",
    "nteraction Elements**: The SSTS fails to include functionality for shifting the vehicle into **any PRND drive mode**, which is crucial in the UC.\n",
    "    3. **Unaddressed User Scenarios**: The UC includes features like **playing radio and using voice commands for station search**, which are absent in the SSTS.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Recommended Actions:\n",
    "    - **Add Missing Functionality**: Ensure the SSTS includes all key UC requirements, such as SWP restrictions and media control.\n",
    "    - **Revise Interaction Design**: Update the SSTS to support proper vehicle mode shifting and media features as per the UC.\n",
    "    - **Address Uncovered Scenarios**: Ensure the SSTS reflects all essential user behaviors from the UC to ensure a complete user experience.\n",

    "    - **Major functional omissions**: If the SSTS document is missing critical functional requirements, such as the inability to support basic user interactions or scenarios that are defined in the UC.\n",

    "    - **Missing core functionality**: A system feature described in the UC, such as an essential user authentication process or data validation step, is entirely absent or inaccurately described in the SSTS.\n",
    "    - **Incorrect interaction design**: The UC specifies a multi-step process for user input, but the SSTS describes a completely different or overly simplified flow that would break user expectations or reduce usability.\n",
    "    - **Incomplete error handling**: The UC defines specific error scenarios and recovery processes, but the SSTS either omits these completely or includes incorrect solutions that fail to resolve critical issues in practice.\n",

    "    The SSTS document requires **substantial revisions** to align with the UC. Key areas for improvement include:\n",
